<img src="images/dropcap_03.jpg" alt="H" title="H" /></div>
<p class="dropcapsection"><span class="firstwords">
<span style="display: none;">H</span>atty Lee</span> had been on a visit to her
grandmother, and now she was coming
home.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee had hard work that morning
to keep her young people in
order, for Hatty was a favorite with
her brothers and sister, and they were wild
with delight at the idea of seeing her
again.</p>

<p>Hatty was only ten years of age, and Marcus,
her brother, thought because he was two
years older he was almost a man, and quite
able to give Hatty advice on all subjects.
He pretended a great contempt for girls, but
the fact was he had missed his little playmate
sorely, and was full of glee at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
thought of her return. He showed his
pleasure in a noisy way that made the house
not very comfortable for any one else.</p>

<p>Old Aunt Barbara had twice put her head
out of her bed-room door, to tell him he was
the &#8220;roughest, rudest boy in the world, and
would drive her crazy if he did not behave
himself;&#8221; but Marcus still ran up stairs, jumping
up three steps at a time, with his heavy
shoes, and sliding down the balusters, hallooing
as he went, as if he were riding a race
in an open meadow.</p>

<p>Meggy, a mischievous little girl of six,
joined her shouts with those of Marcus,
while Harry, her next brother, was busy
collecting all his new playthings in the hall,
that he might show them to &#8220;sister Hatty&#8221;
as soon as she arrived.</p>

<p>As drums and trumpets were among his
favorite toys, they of course had to be brought
out, and thoroughly tried to prove that they
were in perfect order.</p>

<p>While all this tumult was going on in the
hall, Mrs. Lee was vainly trying to hush the
continual cries of her little baby, who, though
only five weeks old, seemed to have remarkably
strong lungs for its age, and to promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to resemble the rest of the family in his willingness
to use them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee was not very strong, and she was
getting quite worn out with the screams of
the baby, when old Aunt Barbara came
stepping into the nursery, and declared that
she was certain if she could take the child a
moment, she could quiet it.</p>

<p>Aunt Barbara put the baby on her lap,
and began to say to it some of the queer old
rhymes she had heard in her childhood,
seventy years ago. It is not likely that the
baby understood aunt Barbara&#8217;s funny stories,
and wanted to listen,&mdash;but this is certain,
it stopped crying, and soon closed its eyes
and fell into a sweet sleep.</p>

<p>When there was silence in the nursery,
the noise in the hall sounded all the louder.
Mrs. Lee stepped to the door quickly, as if
she were going to speak severely to the
children, but something within her whispered
that they had no idea of the pain
their frolic was giving, and that it was joy
about their sister&#8217;s return that made them so
unusually full of glee. When Mrs. Lee
reached the head of the stairs, her face had
a sweet motherly expression, and before she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
spoke, she could not help smiling to see little
Harry blowing away at his trumpet with all
his might, and marching up and down the
hall as if he were a fat little soldier on parade,
while they jumped up and down, and
screamed with delight, to see how fast Marcus
could move on his smooth-backed horse.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee knew that in their present state
of mind it would be next to impossible to keep
the children perfectly quiet, and she resolved
to employ them about something, that they
might not waste their energy in making a
noise.</p>

<p>Marcus heard somebody at the head of the
stairs, and he looked up with an expression
of provoking mischief, as if ready to receive
another scolding from aunt Barbara. When
he saw his mother&#8217;s kind, pale face bending
towards him, he felt a little ashamed of the
thoughtlessness which had made him forget
that her weak head might have suffered from
what he called his &#8220;fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mother,&#8221; he said looking up cheerfully,
&#8220;how soon do you think Hatty will
come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for an hour yet, my son,&#8221; said the
mother, kindly; &#8220;and, meanwhile, I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
something for you to do. I want you to
sweep the pavement, from the door-step to
the gate, that it may look neat and tidy to
Hatty when she comes home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Meg, you go get me a broom, and
I&#8217;ll set to work in a twinkling,&#8221; said Marcus,
jumping down from the balusters, with a
deafening stamp of his heavy shoes.</p>

<p>The sound seemed to touch every nerve
in Mrs. Lee&#8217;s head, and she drew her eyebrows
together with an expression of pain;
but she only said, quietly&mdash;&#8220;I must have a
pair of slippers for you to wear in the house,
Marcus, and then you can take off your
shoes, when you come in, as your father
does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O that will be first-rate,&#8221; said Marcus,
with delight. &#8220;I should like dog&#8217;s-heads for
the pattern; won&#8217;t you begin them to-day,
Mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will make them as soon as I can,&#8221; said
the mother, with a languid smile.</p>

<p>Meg now came running along the hall,
carrying the broom by the brush end, while
the handle went &#8220;knock, knock,&#8221; along the
floor, keeping time to the skipping motion
with which she generally moved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>Marcus seized the broom, and began to
flourish it this way and that way, across the
wide pavement, as if he meant to be rapid,
if not particularly thorough, in his work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Harry,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee, quietly,
&#8220;mother wants you to make a nice fence
with your blocks all round your playthings.
Meg will get them for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>From a closet under the stairs Meg soon
dragged out a box in which were Harry&#8217;s
stores of blocks,&mdash;playthings of which he
never tired, and which never wore out.</p>

<p>The little fellow set to work very patiently;
and then Mrs. Lee said, &#8220;Come, Meg, I
will take you with me.&#8221; Meg gave her
hand to her mother, and skipped up the
stairs, ready to take in good part anything
that should happen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee led her to a small room at the
end of the hall, and said, &#8220;Now listen to me,
my little darling. You are to sleep in here
with Hatty, and she is to help you dress, and
to be very kind to you. I want you to be
very careful not to hurt any of Hatty&#8217;s
things, and to mind her, when I am not
with you. If you do as I say, you will be
sure to get on well.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>Meg gave a little jump, and perched herself
on the edge of the bed, as she said, &#8220;O
how nice, Mother! I am so glad. It is a
great deal pleasanter than being in the old
nursery with Jane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t sit on the bed, Meggy,&#8221; said Mrs.
Lee, helping the little thing gently down&mdash;and
smoothing the tumbled place she had
made on the clean counterpane; &#8220;You know
Hatty likes to keep her bed very nicely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hatty can&#8217;t lock the door now&mdash;and say,
&#8216;You can&#8217;t come in, Meg.&#8217; It is my room, too,
now,&#8221; said Meg, &#8220;and I shall have a right
to come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope my little girls will get on very
pleasantly together,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee, gently.
&#8220;Jesus&#8217; little children never quarrel, never
speak bad, angry words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t, Mother, if I can help it,&#8221;
said Meg, and she put up her mouth to be
kissed, as if that mother&#8217;s kiss could ensure
her doing right.</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on up
stairs, Marcus had stopped in the midst of
his work, and was actually still, for a moment,
while his face bore the marks of deep
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>Marcus did not feel altogether comfortable
about the way he had spoken to Aunt Barbara
that morning; he knew he had done
wrong, and that brought to his mind a letter
his mother had received from Hatty during
her absence. Hatty had written that she
was very sorry for all the naughty things
she had ever done, and that she had made
up her mind to be one of Jesus&#8217; little children,
and that she believed He had forgiven
her for all the past, and would help her to
be a better girl. She sent much love to her
brothers and sisters, and said she wanted
them to forget every unkind word she had
ever spoken to them, for she was very sorry,
and never meant to do so again.</p>

<p>Ever since Hatty could speak, her mother
had been teaching her about her Heavenly
Father, and trying to make her love Him
and wish to serve Him. The little girl had
always listened patiently, but Mrs. Lee had
never been satisfied that Hatty had made her
choice to be among the lambs of Jesus&#8217;
flock, who love to hear their Shepherd&#8217;s
voice, and try to follow Him. This letter,
therefore, written in the frankness and simplicity
of childhood, had brought joy to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
mother&#8217;s heart. She believed that the love
of Christ had taken root in the soul of her
child, and that by God&#8217;s grace it would grow
and strengthen, and in time bear such fruit
as angels love to see.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee had not only given the message
Hatty sent to her brothers and sister, but
she had read her letter to them, praying
silently that by Hatty&#8217;s example they might
be led to choose God for their guardian and
guide.</p>

<p>Marcus had listened intently, and had been
moved more than he cared to show. When
his mother laid the letter down, he said bluntly,
&#8220;I have nothing laid up against Hatty,&#8221;
and abruptly left the room.</p>

<p>Now as he stood on the pavement leaning
upon the broom, he was thinking of Hatty
and her new resolution, and wondering if he
should ever make up his mind to do right.
Of one thing he was sure, doing wrong gave
him no pleasure. He had been too well
taught to be able to commit any sin, without
being reminded of it by his conscience,
but to obey that conscience was another thing.</p>

<p>Marcus could not help fancying that he
should see some great change in Hatty, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
she would look differently, speak differently,&mdash;and
he made up his mind not to be at all
pleased with her if she affected any new,
serious ways. This was but a momentary
feeling, for Marcus really loved his sister,
and in the depths of his heart he rejoiced
that she had chosen the best portion, the only
blessing that will last forever and ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II.</h2>


<div class="initial" style="clear: both">
<img src="images/dropcap_13.jpg" alt="M" title="M" /></div>
<p class="dropcapsection"><span class="firstwords">
<span style="display: none;">M</span>arcus</span> spent so much time in meditating
about Hatty and her new resolution,
that he had but just finished
his task, when the carriage, so anxiously
desired, drove up to the door,
and out jumped Mr. Lee, followed
in another moment by Hatty.</p>

<p>Marcus threw down his broom, and sprang
forward, and before he thought he had kissed
Hatty several times. Marcus was not much
in favor of kissing,&mdash;he thought it was &#8220;girlish;&#8221;
but now he was so really glad, he did
not think what he was about.</p>

<p>While Mr. Lee was attending to the removal
of his carpet-bag, Hatty&#8217;s little trunk,
and sundry baskets and packages with
which the carriage was loaded, Marcus and
Hatty walked up the wide pavement together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>&#8220;You are a good sweeper, Marcus,&#8221; said
Hatty, looking at the clean bricks upon
which they were stepping.</p>

<p>Marcus did not answer; he was gazing
straight into Hatty&#8217;s face to see if she were
really altered. He could see no change,
save that a few freckles about her nose disfigured
her uncommonly fair skin, and told
of the life in the open air she had lately led.
Her red hair had not grown a shade darker
during her absence, although it was brushed
a little smoother than usual. Her bright,
reddish brown eyes had their own lively expression,
and her mouth seemed as ready as
ever to smile, until all about it the tiny dimples
came like little pin-pricks in her fair
skin.</p>

<p>Hatty&#8217;s face was not changed, certainly;
and instead of having the grave manner that
Marcus expected, she was all joy at her return,
and seemed to have forgotten that she
meant to be any better than any one else.</p>

<p>Hatty had not forgotten her new resolutions,
and if Marcus could have seen into
her heart at the moment she stepped from
the carriage, he would have read a prayer
that she might be able to live among her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
dear brothers and sister like one of the
lambs of the flock of Christ.</p>

<p>Meg and Harry had heard the sound of
the carriage wheels, and were on the door-step
to receive Hatty. They first almost
smothered her with kisses; then Meg untied
her bonnet strings with rough kindness, and
Harry seized her little travelling bag, as if it
were his especial property.</p>

<p>Hatty was a particular little soul, and the
way Meg took hold of the new blue satin
ribbons of her leghorn flat, hurt her as
much as if Meg had given her one of the
twisting little pinches she knew so well how
to inflict. Hatty was going to twitch away,
but instead of the twitch came a bright blush
on her cheek, that she should have so soon
been near being out of patience, when again
among the little ones at home. As a kind
of punishment to herself, she let Meg lay
aside her bonnet, and suffered Harry to run
off with her pretty travelling bag, without
saying a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Mother?&#8221; asked Hatty, eagerly,
passing along the hall, and going directly up
stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, here, my child,&#8221; said the mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
as she met her on the landing, and folded
her affectionately in her arms.</p>

<p>Very pleasant it was to Hatty to receive
that mother&#8217;s tender kiss, but dearer still
were the words which were, breathed in her
ear: &#8220;God bless you, my darling, you are
dearer to me than ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hatty understood her mother&#8217;s earnest
words, and she could have echoed them,
&#8220;you are dearer to me than ever.&#8221; That
was exactly what she felt. The mother who
had talked to her of the blessed Jesus, and
taught her His words and ways, was dearer
than ever, now that she had resolved to follow
Him.</p>

<p>In silence Hatty and her mother ascended
the short flight of stairs that led to the upper
hall; then the little girl asked eagerly&mdash;&#8220;But
where is the baby? I have not seen him yet&mdash;or
Aunt Barbara, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you did think of Aunt Barbara. I
didn&#8217;t know but you had forgotten me entirely,
you were so taken up with your
grandma,&#8221; said the old lady, coming slowly
out of the nursery.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed, I had not forgotten you,&#8221;
said Hatty, and she kissed her affectionately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Hatty had not forgotten Aunt Barbara;
she had had painful reasons for remembering
her. The unfortunate, disrespectful
words she had spoken to the old lady, had
risen up to her again and again, and made
her pray with double earnestness to be forgiven
for Jesus&#8217; sake.</p>

<p>Aunt Barbara led the way to the nursery,
and there on the bed lay the baby, the pet of
the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;O what a dear, tiny little creature!&#8221; said
Hatty, bending over it, with a look half wonder
and half affection. &#8220;I never saw such
a little baby before; that is, I don&#8217;t remember
Harry very well, when he was so young,&#8221;
she added, for Hatty was trying to be truthful,
even about trifles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Harry was twice as big at the same age,&#8221;
said Aunt Barbara. &#8220;He always was a
bouncer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hatty stooped down to kiss the wee mouth
of the sleeping baby, but Aunt Barbara
pushed her roughly back, and said impatiently:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t, child! don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll wake
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma does not say I mustn&#8217;t!&#8221; sprang
to Hatty&#8217;s lips, for she was sadly quick-tempered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
but again a blush of shame took the
place of hasty words.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will wake soon,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee, quickly
but quietly, &#8220;and then, Hatty, you can
hold him in your arms; he is not much heavier
than your dolly, Susan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Mother. I should like that,&#8221;
said Hatty; she felt that her mother had
wished to speak quickly to keep her from
wrong words, and she was grateful for the
kindness that would help her to do right.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Hatty, you had better come to your
room, and take off your things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To <i>our</i> room,&#8221; said Meg, with a saucy,
mischievous look.</p>

<p>Hatty turned towards her mother with a
sudden glance of inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee, &#8220;you are to have
Meg for a room-mate.&#8221; Hatty&#8217;s face flushed,
and Mrs. Lee hastened to add, &#8220;I thought
you would like to help me, and you can do
so best by taking Meg with you, and having
a little charge over her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hatty looked very soberly, as she answered,
&#8220;I <i>should</i> like to help you, Mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee opened the two lower drawers of
the bureau, and said, &#8220;you see I have put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
some of Meg&#8217;s clothes here; when you need
any more you can come to me for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mother, where are all my presents,
and my pretty things? That is too bad! I
have always kept them so nicely in those
drawers!&#8221; said Hatty, hastily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee did not speak for a moment; she
opened a door leading into a large lighted
closet, and then said, &#8220;Here, my darling, you
will have a place for all you want to keep
particularly nice; see, I have put your presents
in this drawer, and your books are there
above, on the shelf. I have put a little table
here for your Bible, and you must not forget
to &#8216;enter into your closet,&#8217; to pray to Him
who seeth in secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, Mother, you are so very kind and I
am so very hasty,&#8221; exclaimed Hatty; &#8220;I will
not forget to do as you say, for indeed I need
it. You will have to be very patient with
me, Mother, for I am afraid I shall have hard
work to keep my resolutions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Trust in God for help to struggle against
your faults, and in the end you will conquer,&#8221;
said the mother, with an affectionate kiss, and
then she left her little daughter alone.</p>

<p>Hatty had led an easy, quiet life with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
grandmother for the last three months, and
had had but little temptation to give way to
her hasty temper. Now she began to realize
that it would be quite another thing, where
at almost every moment she was called on
to give up her own will and pleasure for that
of others; but she was not disheartened. God
has promised to give his strength to those
who really wish to serve Him, and on this
promise little Hatty relied. In her closet
she knelt and asked the blessing of Heaven
on her poor efforts, and she rose cheerful and
happy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III.</h2>


<div class="initial" style="clear: both">
<img src="images/dropcap_21.jpg" alt="W" title="W" /></div>
<p class="dropcapsection"><span class="firstwords">
<span style="display: none;">W</span>hen</span> Hatty had arranged her
clothes once more neatly in her
own room, she began to wonder
what had become of Marcus, and
she concluded to go in search of
him; she met him in the hall.
He seemed much excited, and said, &#8220;O Hatty,
what beautiful bantams! I have put them in a
barrel, and carried all the packages grandma
sent, to the kitchen, and now I want to know
where we shall keep them?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hatty was not quite pleased that Marcus
should take the bantams so immediately under
his protection, though she had brought them
as a present to him. She checked the feeling
of annoyance, and said pleasantly, &#8220;They are
yours, Marcus, so you can plan for them as
you think best; but perhaps you could manage
to make a coop, as you do not go to
school to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcus was delighted with the presents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and resolved to set to work immediately to
get the pets into comfortable quarters before
Sunday.</p>

<p>Hatty put on her sun-bonnet, and they both
were soon very busy in the yard, planning
for the chicken coop with as much interest
as if they were going to build some wonderful
specimen of architecture which all the
world would admire.</p>

<p>Marcus found in the wood-house a large
packing box, and after much hammering he
succeeded in knocking out one side, so the
chickens could have their feet on the ground
in their new home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chickens are like the Irishman who liked
a mud floor that would never wear out, and
never need washing,&#8221; said Marcus, with the air
of one who was instructing some ignorant
person.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, grandma has all her coops made that
way,&#8221; said Hatty, who was well pleased to
show that she understood the subject.</p>

<p>Marcus now selected a board of the right
length, and had just begun to split it up into
slabs for the front of the coop, when he heard
Aunt Barbara&#8217;s bed-room window go up.</p>

<p>Marcus did not raise his eyes, but he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
not stop his ears, and he had to hear the shrill
tone that called out, &#8220;Stop! stop! Marcus Lee!&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcus rested his hatchet on the board,
and looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a wasteful boy!&#8221; began Aunt
Barbara. &#8220;You ought to be ashamed to cut
up that good board!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind her,&#8221; said Marcus, in an undertone,
as he resumed his work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, Marcus,&#8221; said Hatty; and
then raising her voice she called out, &#8220;Aunt
Barbara, we want a coop for the chickens&mdash;some
dear little bantams I brought from
grandma&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chickens!&#8221; said Aunt Barbara, much as
if she had said bears! &#8220;What on earth did
you bring them here for? why, they&#8217;ll ruin
everything in the garden, and crow so in the
morning nobody can sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to shut them up, Aunt
Barbara, and that will keep them out of mischief,&#8221;
said Hatty, trying to speak pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take your own way! take your own
way! Its never any use for me to say anything!&#8221;
said Aunt Barbara, and her window
was put down with such a force that made
the glass rattle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>Marcus had expected to hear Hatty answer
in her usual hasty way, and he was quite
surprised to see that she did not seem at all
angry, and now had no unkind remarks to
make about Aunt Barbara. He did not
know that Hatty had been obliged to cast
one look up to the clear sky, to remember
the Great Being who was looking down upon
her, before she dare trust herself to speak,
nor did he know that she was now wondering
why Aunt Barbara should be so unlike
her dear, dear grandma.</p>

<p>Marcus kept steadily on at his work, but
Hatty did not feel satisfied about it until she
had asked her mother if there was really any
harm in what they were doing. After Mrs.
Lee had given them free permission to go on,
the morning passed pleasantly away in
watching Marcus, and she was quite surprised
when the dinner bell rang.</p>

<p>&#8220;O dear!&#8221; said Hatty, &#8220;we shall have
hardly time to put ourselves in order for the
table.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although Marcus knew that it was his
mother&#8217;s express wish that he should never
come to the table without looking neat and
tidy, he paid little regard to his personal appearance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
but there was something in the
eager way in which Hatty hastened to brush
the hair she had been too much inclined to
neglect, that had its influence on him.</p>

<p>Hatty was in her seat before her father
was at the table, and a pleased smile crossed
her face as she saw that Marcus had been
using the clothes brush, and combing his
straight black hair off his high forehead.</p>

<p>The dinner hour was always a pleasant
time at Mrs. Lee&#8217;s, for then all the family
were together, and some interesting conversation
was sure to take place. Marcus was a
restless boy, active in body and mind. He
enjoyed his father&#8217;s society, and affected to
think that he was the only one in the family
who was really a suitable companion for a
boy of the mature age of twelve!</p>

<p>Mr. Lee was a merchant; he had lately
met with large losses, but he did not allow
himself to be saddened by misfortunes that
left his home untouched, and all his dear
ones alive and well. Mr. Lee was a tall,
slender man, with a bright, expressive eye,
and a large, pleasant mouth, and his children
thought him the handsomest man in Hyde,
the large inland town where he lived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>During the dinner-hour on the day about
which we are writing, Mr. Lee was talking of
a plan for building an Orphan Asylum, about
which the citizens of Hyde were greatly interested.</p>

<p>Marcus listened to his father&#8217;s remarks, and
seemed to think himself called upon to reply.
He did so, and showed uncommon quickness
and good sense for a boy of his years in what
he said. Mrs. Lee modestly made some suggestions,
which her husband thought particularly
useful; but Marcus&#8217; lip curled as his
mother spoke, in a way which it was well
for him escaped his father&#8217;s observation.
After dinner, Mr. Lee was obliged to hurry
away, but not too soon to give Hatty a kiss,
and to say to her how pleasant it was to see
her face once more at the table.</p>

<p>When Mr. Lee was gone, Mrs. Lee resumed
the subject about which they had been talking,
and sketched what she thought would
be an improvement on the internal arrangement
of the proposed building.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t, Mother!&#8221; said Marcus.
&#8220;What do women know about such things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do boys know? you had better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
say!&#8221; said Hatty, hastily taking part with
her mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any sensible boy of twelve knows more
about such things than a woman!&#8221; said Marcus,
turning to leave the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, Marcus,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee, gently.</p>

<p>Marcus stopped, but did not approach his
mother. She stepped to his side and said:
&#8220;Marcus, there was once a boy of twelve
who had more wisdom than the learned doctors
in the Jewish Temple. He, of course,
knew more than his mother. Yet he went
down with her to Nazareth, and was subject
unto her. Even he was not above honoring
his father and mother. Will you not
try to imitate him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcus was softened by his mother&#8217;s
gentle manner, and he answered: &#8220;If I
don&#8217;t behave as I ought to you, Mother, it is
a great shame;&#8221; and then he was again turning
away.</p>

<p>Again he was detained. Hatty laid her
hand on his arm and said: &#8220;Marcus, I did
not speak rightly to you just now. I was
angry. I am sorry.&#8221; Hatty blushed painfully
when she spoke, and it was evident the acknowledgment
cost her a great effort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&#8220;I did not notice it,&#8221; said Marcus, hurrying
away.</p>

<p>Hatty felt a little hurt at the way her
apology was received, but her mother took
her by the hand, and said: &#8220;That is right,
Hatty. Confess your faults one to another,
and pray one for another. You must not
forget Marcus in your prayers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hatty was silent a moment, and then her
mother said: &#8220;Come now, my dear, the baby
is awake, and you will have an opportunity
to see his queer little blue eyes, and to hold
him in your lap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hatty was delighted when she reached the
nursery, to be allowed to take the tiny being
in her arms, and to hold his pretty soft hand
in hers.</p>

<p>Meg and Harry seemed to think it was a
very attractive sight to see Hatty with the
baby on her lap, and they left their soap-bubbles
and came to stand about her.</p>

<p>At this moment Aunt Barbara came in.
She did not seem to notice Hatty and the
baby. Her eyes at once fell upon the bowl
full of soap-suds Meg had placed on a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear! dear!&#8221; exclaimed Aunt Barbara,
&#8220;what are the children coming to? Why,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
they waste soap as if it grew, instead of cost
money! Here, Meg, pour this away directly,
and don&#8217;t do such a thing again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t help it to throw it away,&#8221; said
Meg. &#8220;I want to blow bubbles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shan&#8217;t have it! shan&#8217;t have it!&#8221; said little
Harry, holding tight to the edge of the
bowl with his little fat hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Barbara,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee, very
gently, &#8220;I told the children they might blow
bubbles a little while this afternoon. Jane
mixed the soap for them, that they need not
be wasteful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Its little use savin&#8217; in such a house as
this!&#8221; said Aunt Barbara, and she walked
away as if she were particularly injured.</p>

<p>Marcus now came in to tell how happy
and contented the chickens seemed in the
new coop. He saw some evidences of displeasure
on the faces of Meg and Harry, and
he exclaimed, &#8220;I met Aunt Barbara in the
hall, with her indignation strut on. What&#8217;s
up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marcus, my son, I cannot bear to hear
you speak in that way of any old person,
especially of Aunt Barbara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she is too tiresome and provoking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Mother. If I want a piece of twine for a
kite-string she calls it wasteful, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; broke in Meg, &#8220;and when I want
to play tea, she won&#8217;t let me have a bit of
milk or sugar,&mdash;that is, if mother is not
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, hush, my children,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee,
with a look of pain. &#8220;Come, sit down all
of you, and I will tell you a story.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcus liked to hear stories as well as little
Meg herself, and he forthwith sat down
on the floor, where he could look straight
into his mother&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee began: &#8220;Once there was a little
orphan girl, only seven years old. Her father
and mother died, and she did not know
what was to become of her. Now this little
girl had an aunt, who was the widow of a
clergyman. This aunt had a little cottage of
her own, and just enough money to live
quietly and comfortably by herself. She
knew if she took the little orphan to her
home, she must deny herself a great many
comforts to which she had always been accustomed;
but she resolved to do it.</p>

<p>The little girl was very glad when she
found that she was not alone in the wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
world, and she soon learned to love the kind
aunt who did so much for her.</p>

<p>Sometimes she was surprised to see what
care her aunt took, that nothing should be
wasted; and she often wondered why her
aunt did not buy herself a new bonnet, or a
new dress, which she seemed to need. She
did not know that her aunt had to practice
so much care and economy, to give her a
home. By and by, when she grew older,
she understood all this, and tried to be like a
daughter to the friend who had been so kind
to her. Her aunt&#8217;s queer little ways only
made her feel, then, that it was for her she
had learned to save even the shreds she cut
off when she was sewing. After the orphan
girl was grown, she was married to a very
kind gentleman. This gentleman was so
grateful to the aunt for her care of the orphan,
that he wanted her to come and live
with them in her comfortable home; but
Aunt Barbara said&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, Mother! you have let it
out,&#8221; exclaimed the children in a breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Hatty; &#8220;what did
Aunt Barbara say, Mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She said, your old aunty is queer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
notional, and maybe you would be happier
without her. No, no, let me stay here alone;
I shall be quite contented to know my little
orphan is so well taken care of! It was of
no use urging Aunt Barbara, so we had to
let her have her way. Now, my children,
you know how Aunt Barbara got her very
economical ways, and I hope you will have
patience with her, for my sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I will!&#8221; said Hatty, looking up
with her eyes full of tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t tease her any more,&#8221; said Meg,
nestling at her mother&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>Marcus was silent; he felt too deeply to
speak, how ill a return he had made to
Aunt Barbara for her kindness to his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how came Aunt Barbara here?&#8221;
asked Hatty, with much interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee. &#8220;We
had been married three years, when I had a
little, helpless, sickly baby. I was too feeble
to take proper care of it, and your father was
obliged to be too much away from home to
give me any help. Aunt Barbara heard
how weak and pale I was looking, and what
a poor, suffering baby I had. Then the old
lady let her little home to a stranger, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
came one day to us. She said she could not
sleep for thinking of me and the little one,
and she had come to take care of us. And
what good care she took of us! She seemed
to know just what I wanted. I was young,
then, and there were many things about
which I was as ignorant as you are. Aunt
Barbara had nourishing food made for me
just when I needed it, she took the care of
the housekeeping from me, and so nursed me
that I soon began to feel strong again. But
I have not told you about the poor baby.
Aunt Barbara could not do too much for that
baby. It was a cross little thing, crying even
when it was not sick. Aunt Barbara was
never out of patience with it. She attended
to its food, got up with it at night, and even
when I was well enough to take it with me
again, she was hardly willing to give it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this watching and nursing was too
much for Aunt Barbara; she has never been
well since. When her rheumatism keeps her
awake at night, she is often irritable and inclined
to find fault the next day. When I
feel tempted to be out of patience with her,
I have only to remember that it was for me
and my little baby she came here, and that for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
us she wearied herself until her health gave
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Hatty, in a whisper, &#8220;was
I that little sickly baby that Aunt Barbara
was so patient with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my darling,&#8221; was Mrs. Lee&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>The many impertinent, hasty, impatient
words that she had spoken to her old aunt,
returned to Hatty&#8217;s mind, and she resolved
to ask God to give her strength to make
amends for the past.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a sad truth,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee, &#8220;that
old people have much less patience shown
towards them than little children have, yet
they need it quite as much. God has so arranged
it, that those who are watched over
and taken care of when they are helpless
babes, should in their turn nurse and comfort
the feeble old age of their parents. Remember,
my children, old age makes people
in one way like infants; that is, it leads them to
be irritable and troublesome, and often helpless,
and these defects should be borne with
tenderly, as your father or I would soothe that
dear baby on Hatty&#8217;s lap. God has taught
in his holy book the greatest respect to the
aged, and his eye sees with displeasure even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
a rude look cast towards one who is grey-haired.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children were all silent. Mrs. Lee
saw that they were moved, and in her heart
she prayed that God would grant a blessing
upon the earnest words she had spoken, and
save her dear ones from falling into the sin
so offensive to the Holy One of Israel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV.</h2>


<div class="initial" style="clear: both">
<img src="images/dropcap_36.jpg" alt="W" title="W" /></div>
<p class="dropcapsection"><span class="firstwords">
<span style="display: none;">W</span>hen</span> Hatty went to bed, on the
evening of her return, she found
Meg fast asleep, and apparently
as much at home as if she had
always had a right to talk of &#8220;our
room,&#8221; instead of being one of
the children in the nursery.</p>

<p>Hatty looked at the little brown face lying
on the pillow, and the long dark lashes
hiding the mischievous eyes, and she felt
that she loved her little sister dearly, and
would be willing to be put to a great deal
of inconvenience to be of service to her.
When Hatty knelt that night in the quiet
closet her mother had given up to her use,
she did not forget to pray that she might be
patient and gentle with Meg, and so win her
confidence as to be able to lead her to the
Saviour, who loves to call the little ones His
own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Hatty&#8217;s short reading in the Bible that
evening was about the crucifixion of our Saviour,
and as she prepared to lie down, she
wondered how he could have borne such
suffering without one murmur. Hatty had
a perfect horror of pain. Her skin was thin
and delicate, and even the grasp of a rough
hand on her arm was sure to leave a bruise.
Her usually pleasant face was clouded over
by a scratch or a pin-prick, and her tears
often fell fast for a wound that many children
would have met with a smile. Hatty
was naturally very sensitive to pain, and that
was not her fault; but she had never yet begun
to try to bear it patiently, as a part of
her christian duty. As she lay down that
night, she resolved to be more patient under,
little trials, and to make light of little pains.</p>

<p>Hatty&#8217;s new resolution was soon put to
the test. She had hardly put her head on
the pillow, before she became conscious that
her couch was anything but a bed of roses.</p>

<p>Meg had consoled herself for going to sleep
in a strange room by herself, by munching
hard crackers until that pleasure was lost in
the new joy of the dreams of childhood.
The bed was strewn with the crumbs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
through her thin night-dress Hatty could
feel them in all directions. After brushing
them this way and that way, Hatty jumped
out of bed with an angry bound, and proceeded
to light the candle and rectify the
mischief in a systematic manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;The troublesome little thing!&#8221; exclaimed
Hatty, as she saw a half-eaten cracker lying
in Meg&#8217;s loosened grasp. &#8220;She ought to be
punished for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Hatty thought of her resolution
to be patient under trifling discomforts,
and a feeling of mortification came
over her. Very quietly she brushed away
the offending crumbs, gently she removed
the half-eaten cracker, and then she knelt to
ask forgiveness for this new exhibition of her
hasty temper, ere she again lay down to
rest.</p>

<p>Hatty was soon in a sweet sleep; but
shortly after midnight she was awakened by
a feeling very much as if a broom-handle
were thrust against her, while at the same
time Meg exclaimed, &#8220;Do move, Hatty, you
crowd so. I wish you would&#8217;nt come on my
side of the bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meg was a thin bony little creature, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the children all dreaded a punch with her
sharp elbows almost as much as one of her
scientific pinches.</p>

<p>Hatty&#8217;s tender side actually ached, but
she made an effort to say, gently, &#8220;Meg, you
must be dreaming; wake up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not asleep at all!&#8221; said Meg, pettishly.
&#8220;I wish you would move!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hatty passed her hand along the seam of
the sheet (Mrs. Lee used her old-fashioned
sheets on the children&#8217;s beds) to assure herself
that she was on her own side of the bed,
and then she was going to tell Meg that it
was <i>she</i> who was out of place; but something
checked her, and she only said, pleasantly,
&#8220;Never mind, Meg, where the middle of the
bed is,&mdash;you shall have all the room you
want;&#8221; and making way for her little friend
with the sharp elbows, Hatty composed
herself again to sleep, with a far happier
feeling than if she had contended for her
rights.</p>

<p>Once she was going to say, &#8220;O Meg, it
hurts me still where you punched me,&#8221; but
she checked the words, and thought how
trifling was such a pain compared with the
nails in the hands of our great example, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
has bid us follow him in his patience, as well
as in perfect purity.</p>

<p>Hatty&#8217;s long ride from her grandmother&#8217;s,
a distance of sixteen miles, and the excitement
of her return home, made her sleep
very soundly, when not disturbed, and she
would gladly have continued her nap until
the rousing bell gave forth its summons.</p>

<p>Meg was something like the uneasy birds
who twitter at midnight on their perches,
and wake at dawn to sing, as if they never
knew the need of rest.</p>

<p>By the first grey streak of morning she
began to stir, and was soon wide awake and
full of glee at finding herself in her new
quarters.</p>

<p>Hatty turned her back resolutely, but in
vain. Meg was not to be so easily disposed
of. Hatty was going to say some hasty
words to Meg, as she twitched away from
her, when Meg pleaded, &#8220;Do wake up, sister
Hatty. It is Sunday morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sunday morning!&#8221; that thought brought
Hatty to herself&mdash;and making an effort to
throw off her sleepiness, she turned towards
Meg, and said, &#8220;Well, then, give me a nice
kiss to begin the day.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>Meg gave the kiss with real good will, and
then, nestling up close to Hatty, she began
to talk as if her tongue needed violent exercise
to make up for being quiet all night.</p>

<p>Before many minutes were over, Hatty
had set that little tongue at Sunday work,
repeating all the hymns and Bible verses
that Meg had learned during the three
months that Hatty had been away from
home.</p>

<p>Meg was full of eager questions about her
hymns and her verses, and Hatty had an opportunity
of giving the little one some sweet
lessons about the loving Saviour and what
He wishes in His lambs, that she would
have lost if she had given way to her selfish
wish for a longer nap.</p>

<p>We do not know, when we give way to
our own whims, instead of being unselfish,
what opportunities of usefulness we may be
losing. If we do one duty well, some higher
and more important duty generally follows
close upon it.</p>

<p>Hatty took a pleasure in making Meg look
particularly nice that Sunday morning, and
she was well pleased when her mother smilingly
remarked at breakfast that Meg showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
very plainly that she had fallen into good
hands. &#8220;Hatty needs a little attention, herself,&#8221;
added Mrs. Lee, and she glanced at the
irregular white line which separated the two
heavy masses of waving red hair on each side
of Hatty&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>Hatty would rather have gone without her
breakfast than had her hair parted. Hatty
was apt to fret about being hurt all the while
the operation was going on, and Mrs. Lee
actually dreaded to propose what, if borne
cheerfully, would have been but the work of
a moment. Happily for Hatty at that instant
her thoughts were called in a different direction
by Marcus&#8217; sudden question&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Aunt Barbara this morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>Even the question showed some interest in
the old lady; and Mrs. Lee hailed it as an
indication of a better state of feeling in her
son.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Barbara is not very well this morning;
she did not get up as early as usual,&#8221;
said Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shan&#8217;t I go up to see if I can do anything
for her?&#8221; said Hatty, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She will be down soon, I think; but you
may go,&#8221; said the mother, pleasantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>Hatty ran up stairs, and knocked very
gently on Aunt Barbara&#8217;s door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it? What do you want?&#8221; answered
Aunt Barbara&#8217;s voice from within.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Hatty. Can I do anything for
you?&#8221; said the little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; was at first the decided answer;
then followed a sudden call &#8220;Stop, stop,
child. Come in a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hatty stepped in, but felt like drawing
back as Aunt Barbara stood there, half
dressed, with her grey hair uncovered, and
her thin, shrivelled arms bare.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stare as if you were frightened,&#8221;
said Aunt Barbara, quickly. &#8220;Old people
are not generally very beautiful to look at!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I do anything for you?&#8221; said Hatty,
pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you want to. I can&#8217;t find my
pocket. Perhaps you can see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Barbara wore a pocket tied on under
her dress with a string, and she had been for
some moments looking for it, as she was
ready to put it on.</p>

<p>Hatty glanced round the room, and was
delighted when she saw a piece of white Marseilles
peeping out from under the tumbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
bed-clothes. She sprang towards it, and
handed the pocket to the old lady, who took
it without a word, and went on dressing herself.</p>

<p>Hatty began to pick up the things about
the room, and to throw open the bed; for
she knew Aunt Barbara would not think of
going down to breakfast until the room was
a little in order.</p>

<p>Aunt Barbara did not seem to notice her;
but when she had tied the strings to her
close-quilted muslin cap, and pinned a broad
black ribbon round it, she said: &#8220;Come, now,
child, its not worth while your breakfast
should get cold while you are waiting on
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hatty&#8217;s face brightened, and she said,
eagerly: &#8220;I should be glad to do anything
for you, Aunt Barbara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may have more chance than you
want, if I feel like this many mornings,&#8221; said
Aunt Barbara, very sharply.</p>

<p>Aunt Barbara was not very pleasant at
breakfast that morning. Nothing seemed
cooked to suit her. The fact was, the poor
old lady was not well, and had no appetite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and that made everything seem out of the
way to her.</p>

<p>Hatty could not help noticing how pleasantly
her mother took Aunt Barbara&#8217;s comments
on the breakfast, that would have put
many housekeepers out of patience. When
nothing on the table seemed to suit Aunt
Barbara, Mrs. Lee quietly sent out for a bit
of ham to be boiled; and when it came in,
she seemed pleased that the old lady ate a
few mouthfuls,&mdash;complaining at first that it
was done a trifle too much, and in the end
making way with it all.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee did not seem to notice that Aunt
Barbara was not well,&mdash;at least he did not ask
about her health; and Hatty thought at first
it was not quite right in her father, and she
wondered that he should do anything so unlike
himself. By-and-by she noticed that all
the topics he brought up were such as were
likely to interest Aunt Barbara. He spoke
of meeting an old minister who used to live
near her own home, and told how cheerfully
he talked of his long, active life, and of the
happy time when he should meet his Master
in heaven. Then he brought up the new
orphan asylum, which was always sure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
enlist Aunt Barbara&#8217;s attention; and at last
she seemed to forget her pains, while listening
to his account of the meeting on the subject
he had attended the evening before.</p>

<p>Hatty felt pleased as she saw the shadow
passing from the old lady&#8217;s face, and she
glanced across for Marcus to sympathize in
her satisfaction. He did not see her, but
Hatty noticed that he placed a comfortable
chair, after breakfast, near the window where
Aunt Barbara best loved to sit, and drew a
footstool up to it.</p>

<p>Marcus did not think that anybody observed
him, but two hearts were made glad
by this little effort of kindness. Mrs. Lee
and Hatty both saw that Marcus&#8217; feelings
towards Aunt Barbara had undergone a
happy change. Marcus&#8217; feelings had been
touched, but feelings are a poor dependence
for doing right, without principle.</p>

<p>Hatty was delighted at the idea of going
to church once more in her dear native town.
She felt that it would be a new and better
thing to be there, now that she could count
herself among those who were glad at the
thought, &#8220;God is in His holy temple.&#8221; Hatty
began, in her impatience, to make her preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in very good season. She had laid
out on her bed all the things she expected to
wear, when her mother called her to come
into the nursery.</p>

<p>Hatty went promptly as far as the door,
but she moved across the floor more slowly
when she saw that her mother had a comb
and brush in her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we shall have no trouble about
the hair, this morning. It needs parting,
sadly,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee, in her gentle way.</p>

<p>Hatty&#8217;s mind was made up at that moment;
her mother might pull as hard as was
necessary, <i>she</i> would not say a word if it
hurt her ever so much.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee used the comb very carefully,
yet it was disagreeable, almost painful to
Hatty&#8217;s delicate skin. She shut her mouth
tight, however, and thought of her resolution
to bear little hurts pleasantly, and actually
got through without a murmur.</p>

<p>When the hair was brushed smoothly,
Hatty&#8217;s face looked very sweet from the
effort she had made to do right, and she well
deserved the affectionate kiss her mother
pressed on her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I could help Aunt Barbara get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
ready for church,&#8221; said Hatty, one right action
leading to another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Barbara is not well enough to go,
to-day. I am very sorry, on my own account
as well as on hers. It is Communion
day, and I had hoped to go to church, for
the first time in many weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But cannot you go, Mother?&#8221; said Hatty,
earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my dear,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee, quietly.
&#8220;I do not like to leave Aunt Barbara with
no one to wait upon her. I promised Betsy,
yesterday, that she should go out this morning,
and Jane will be busy with the baby
and Harry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hatty was silent for a moment; a struggle
was going on in her mind. At length she
looked up with a beautiful, bright expression
on her face, and said, &#8220;I will stay with Aunt
Barbara, if you could trust her with me. I
do not want you to be kept at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee knew the effort it must have cost
her little girl to give up the pleasure for
which she had been so eagerly preparing, but
she did not refuse her kind offer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, my darling; I shall feel
quite easy leaving Aunt Barbara with you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
&#8216;I was sick and ye visited me,&#8217; our Saviour
says, and then adds, &#8216;Inasmuch as ye have
done it unto one of the least of these, ye have
done it unto me.&#8217; That thought makes taking
care of the sick doubly pleasant. And
now, darling, instead of putting on your own
things, which are all laid out so nicely, you
will have to help me to get ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hatty was glad to be kept very busy that
she might not have a moment to regret her
choice, and she made herself so actively useful,
that Mrs. Lee was not at all too late in
joining the group waiting for her in the hall
below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why! are you not going, Hatty?&#8221; exclaimed
Marcus, as his sister appeared at her
mother&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hatty is going to stay with Aunt Barbara.
She may need some attention, and I
did not like to leave her alone,&#8221; said Mrs.
Lee.</p>

<p>Marcus looked up in surprise. He knew
with what eagerness Hatty had spoken in
the morning of being at church, and could
not but wonder at the sudden change,&mdash;she
looked so cheerful. One glance at the sweet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
bright expression of her face, convinced him
of the generous motive that had kept her at
home. Marcus began to think there was
some strength in Hatty&#8217;s new resolution to
do right.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V.</h2>


<div class="initial" style="clear: both">
<img src="images/dropcap_51.jpg" alt="A" title="A" /></div>
<p class="dropcapsection"><span class="firstwords">
<span style="display: none;">A</span>unt</span> Barbara&#8217;s room was in the
back building, and the entrance to
it was on the first landing to the
front stairs. The old lady had chosen
that room, when she came to
Mrs. Lee&#8217;s, because no one had ever
occupied it; for she said, &#8220;I never did turn
anybody out, and I never mean to.&#8221;</p>

<p>There Aunt Barbara had collected about
her all her favorite pieces of old-fashioned
furniture, her dark mahogany secretary-bureau,
with its bright brass rings held fast
in the mouths of wrinkled old brass faces,
and her curtained bed, with all its festoons
and fringes.</p>

<p>When Hatty stepped into the room, she
saw Aunt Barbara sitting bolt-upright in a
stuff, straight-backed chair, and looking not
much in the humor for little visitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>&#8220;Aunt Barbara, mother thought perhaps
you would like some one with you this
morning, and so I have brought in my Sunday
books, and will sit here, if you like,&#8221; said
Hatty, in a cheerful tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind your sitting here, if you
choose,&#8221; was the old lady&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>Hatty did not know what to say next, so
she mounted into one of the high, stiff
chairs, and took up a book and tried to
read. Her eyes would wander to Aunt
Barbara, sitting up straight and still, and
looking out of the window at the sky. At
length Hatty said, &#8220;Do lie down, Aunt Barbara;
I am sure you would be more comfortable.
Let me fix your pillows nicely for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never go to bed when I can sit up. I
was not brought up to loll about and make
myself sick by being lazy,&#8221; said Aunt Barbara.</p>

<p>Hatty tried to read for a few moments
more; then Aunt Barbara moved, and she
looked at her again.</p>

<p>The old lady evidently wanted something
she could not find in her pocket, and yet did
not feel like getting up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Hatty glanced her eyes round the room,
and saw Aunt Barbara&#8217;s spectacles on the
mantel-piece.</p>

<p>She jumped up and handed them to
her. &#8220;You may give me my Bible, if you
choose,&#8221; said Aunt Barbara, in a pleasanter
tone than she had used that morning.</p>

<p>Hatty laid the great Bible on Aunt Barbara&#8217;s
lap, and for a few moments the old
lady seemed nodding; but she soon began to
rub her spectacles as if they were not clean,
and then she put her hand to her head, and
said, &#8220;old folks can&#8217;t sit and read all day like
young ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what grandma tells me,&#8221;
said Hatty; &#8220;and she says young people
ought to remember that, and learn a great
many Bible verses to think about when they
are too sick or too old to read.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if they did not do that when they
were young,&#8221; said Aunt Barbara, &#8220;did
grandma say what they should do then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She did not say anything about that,&#8221;
said Hatty, looking puzzled. In another
moment she added, in her most pleasant way,
&#8220;would not you like me to read to you a
little, Aunt Barbara?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>&#8220;If you can make that little tongue of
yours go slow enough, for me to understand,
you may try,&#8221; said Aunt Barbara.</p>

<p>Hatty drew her chair close up to Aunt
Barbara, and was going to ask when she
should begin, when the old lady said, pettishly,
&#8220;Go round to the other side, child!
don&#8217;t you know that&#8217;s my deaf ear?&#8221; Hatty
moved as she was requested, and then Aunt
Barbara told her to read the 103d Psalm.
Hatty was a very pleasant reader, and she
had lately taken great pains not to speak too
rapidly.</p>

<p>Aunt Barbara must have been pleased, for
she kept Hatty reading, reading, until the
family came home from church; and when she
turned to leave the room, she said, &#8220;Thank
you, child; I think going to your grandma&#8217;s
has done you good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee had not told Aunt Barbara of
Hatty&#8217;s letter about her new resolutions, yet
the old lady felt that some change must have
taken place in Hatty to make her willing to
give up her own pleasure to sit in that quiet
room with a sick, fretful old woman, as Aunt
Barbara knew herself to be that morning.</p>

<p>Hatty enjoyed her afternoon at Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
school all the more for the sacrifice she had
made; and when the children all gathered
in the parlor before tea to say their catechism
and Bible verses to their father, she felt as if
she were one of the happiest little girls in the
world.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee was all the afternoon with Aunt
Barbara, and when night came the Doctor
was sent for, and Jane and Betsy were called
in to help Mrs. Lee to get the poor old lady
into bed, for she was very sick.</p>

<p>The Doctor looked soberly, and said the
disease must have been coming on some time&mdash;that
there was a great deal of irritation in her
system, and he could not say how her sickness
might end.</p>

<p>Hatty and Marcus heard the Doctor say
these words in the hall as he went out. The
tears came into Hatty&#8217;s eyes, and she said to
her brother, &#8220;How I wish we had never
spoken a wrong word to Aunt Barbara!&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcus did not reply, but he walked away
to his room, to lie awake with sad, repentant
thoughts.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee had no idea how rude her children
had often been to Aunt Barbara; her presence
had been some check upon them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
though she had heard enough to give her
pain. Aunt Barbara had led for many years
a quiet life, and the noise and restlessness of
children tired and worried her; and latterly
she had been far from well.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee had been for some weeks confined
to her room, and during this time
Aunt Barbara had had much to bear from
Marcus and the little ones; but she never
complained to Mrs. Lee, though she daily
grew more harsh in her own manner to the
children.</p>

<p>A little gentleness, a little patience on the
part of those who were young, healthy and
happy, would have done much to make poor
old Aunt Barbara more pleasant and cheerful.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI.</h2>


<div class="initial" style="clear: both">
<img src="images/dropcap_57.jpg" alt="N" title="N" /></div>
<p class="dropcapsection"><span class="firstwords">
<span style="display: none;">N</span>ow</span> came an anxious period in Hatty&#8217;s
home. Mrs. Lee, and a nurse who
was hired for the purpose, spent their
time in Aunt Barbara&#8217;s room, while
the Doctor came and went with a
troubled, serious air.</p>

<p>On Hatty, meanwhile, fell the care of Meg
and Harry. Hatty found having Meg in her
room by no means so troublesome as she had
expected. Meg&#8217;s desire to meddle with
Hatty&#8217;s things, and to put them out of order,
seemed to have gone now that she could say
&#8220;our room.&#8221; She even made herself a kind
of guardian against Harry&#8217;s inroads; and
when she heard his little feet pattering that
way, she would get in advance of him with
her swift skips, and have the door shut before
he reached it.</p>

<p>Hatty found it quite impossible to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the children quiet, so she managed to have
them in the garden as much as she could, in
pleasant weather, that they might not disturb
Aunt Barbara.</p>

<p>At the foot of the wide walk that led
down between the flower beds, was a pleasant
arbour, and here Hatty made a kind of
a little home of her own. Marcus put up a
tight box on one of the seats, and there
Hatty kept a store of books and playthings
for herself and the children, to make the
place attractive, and looked so bright and
happy herself, that when Marcus came from
school he was glad to leave the dull, quiet
house, to join the circle in the arbour.</p>

<p>Hatty was busy sewing there, one day,
while Meg made a parasol for her doll, of a
maple leaf, and Harry drew a long-necked
squash up and down the walk for a carriage.
Suddenly Hatty heard Marcus come out the
back door, whistling a cheerful tune. Hatty
tucked her work in her pocket, and quickly
picked up some bits of bright-colored worsted
that were scattered over her dress.</p>

<p>Marcus came down the walk, kicking a
ball before him, and leaped into the arbour
with a regular bound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>&#8220;Well, Hatty,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;I was head
of my class to-day, and did not get a mark
for being late, either. So I stand a chance
for the prize yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you not late?&#8221; asked Hatty, with
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;O yes!&#8221; answered Marcus, with a laugh.
&#8220;The boys were all on their knees when I
went in, but I opened the door quietly, and
nobody heard me; so I got off famously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what did you say when your name
was called? You did not tell an untruth,
Marcus?&#8221; said Hatty, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed!&#8221; said Marcus, indignantly.
&#8220;I am above that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it at all,&#8221; said Hatty,
uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, this was the way. When Mr.
Briggs called over the names for punctuality,
some how or other his attention wandered
just before he got to my name, and he
skipped it, so I did not have to answer at all.
After Mr. Briggs went out I looked at my
name, and there was a cross after it for
punctual; so you see it is all right, and my
chance for the prize is as good as ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather have a brother who told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the truth, than one who got the prize,&#8221; said
Hatty, earnestly. &#8220;Dear Marcus, won&#8217;t you
tell Mr. Briggs about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do no such thing. Girls are so
silly! You never can make them understand
anything,&#8221; said Marcus, hastily.</p>

<p>But Hatty did understand. She felt that
Marcus had acted a lie for the sake of winning
the prize he so greatly desired. She
knew he would be angry if she said anything
more about it; but she could not be
silent and let him do wrong, without one
more effort. After a moment, in which she
asked God to help her to keep down her own
quick temper if Marcus should make a harsh
reply, Hatty said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Marcus, you know what mother tells us
about the book where what we call secret
things are written down, to be read on the
great day when all things will be known.
Something will stand against your name,
there, worse than a mark for being unpunctual.
Dear Marcus, do tell the truth, and not
mind the prize. You will not care about the
prize when you are happy with the beautiful
angels in Heaven; but you will love to remember
how you did right, when it came so
very hard.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>It had cost Hatty a great effort to say all
this, and now she burst into tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Girls are so silly!&#8221; said Marcus, impatiently.
&#8220;I wish you would not set up to
lecture me, Miss?&#8221; and the brother walked
angrily away.</p>

<p>&#8220;For shame! For shame!&#8221; shouted little
Meg, who had been an unnoticed listener to
the conversation, and her slender finger was
pointed at her brother. He took no notice
of her; and she turned to Hatty, and threw
her arms round her neck, and said: &#8220;Don&#8217;t
cry, sister. Meg will be a good girl. I will
try very hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you, Meg?&#8221; said Hatty, brightening.
&#8220;Then I shall be very happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Meg had only wanted to say something
to comfort Hatty, and had spoken the
first words that came into her mind, without
thinking what they meant. When she saw
Hatty seem so much pleased, she thought to
herself: &#8220;I do mean to try, if Hatty wants
it so very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Harry&#8217;s voice was heard
in loud, angry screams. Hatty and Meg ran
to the spot from whence they came. Marcus
walked sheepishly away, as they appeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
ashamed to own that in his ill-humor he had
been teasing his little brother.</p>

<p>Harry was a sweet-tempered, affectionate
little fellow, ready to put up his mouth to
kiss anybody who smiled upon him; but
now he had been too far provoked to bear
all patiently.</p>

<p>Marcus had run away with his yellow
carriage and dashed it against a stone, until
all the seeds that had been riding about so
comfortably were scattered far and wide on
the grass. Then, because he looked displeased,
and said, &#8220;Naughty boy!&#8221; Marcus
had perched him on the high chicken-coop,
and left him to scream for himself, or roll off
as he best could.</p>

<p>Hatty took the little fellow in her arms
and wiped away his tears. She promised to
hunt with him for a &#8220;beautiful squash,&#8221;
larger than the one he had lost,&mdash;and he was
soon comforted, and began to smooth her
face and say, &#8220;Dear Hatty&mdash;Hatty so dood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Hatty is so good,&#8221; echoed Meg.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sister is only trying to be good,&#8221; said
Hatty, modestly. But the praise of the little
ones went to her heart.</p>

<p>Marcus was sulky towards Hatty all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
noon. He did not go out to help her feed
the bantams, though she went through the
room where he was, with the food in her
hand, to give him a chance, if he wished, to
join her pleasantly.</p>

<p>Hatty loved her brother, and since she had
been making an effort to govern her temper,
she had enjoyed being with him. He, too,
found in her a very pleasant companion. She
was ready to listen to him when he talked,
and let herself be instructed, though she
sometimes knew as much as he did about the
subjects of which he was speaking. Marcus
did not teaze Hatty much of late, as she had
learned to laugh, herself, even when he
warmed his hands by her red hair, or asked
her if she was so hot-tempered that she had
set her head on fire in a passion.</p>

<p>Marcus was glad that day when it came
time for him to go to school again, though he
generally thought the intermission quite too
short. He missed Hatty, and he felt uneasy
about what she had said. An uncomfortable
feeling was at his heart. He was acting a
lie! The truth had been plainly told him,
and he could not forget it.</p>

<div class="initial" style="clear: both">
<img src="images/dropcap_64.jpg" alt="M" title="M" /></div>
<p class="dropcapsection"><span class="firstwords">
<span style="display: none;">M</span>arcus</span> was very cross to Hatty for
a day or two after their conversation
in the arbour; and whenever
he was in the house he kept the
children perpetually uncomfortable
with his teasing.</p>

<p>Hatty had all this to bear in silence, for she
would not trouble her mother with complaints
when she had so much on her mind.</p>

<p>Saturday came, and Marcus was to be at
home all day. Hatty actually dreaded it.
She did not know how she should get
through so many hours, with Marcus about
the house, so she resolved to go early to the
arbour, and perhaps he would not follow her
there.</p>

<p>Marcus lounged about by himself for a
while, and at last, out of loneliness, he went
down to the arbour, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>Hatty looked up pleasantly as he drew
near, and said: &#8220;Why can&#8217;t you get a book,
Marcus, and read something to Meg and
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Meg and you!&#8221; said Marcus, contemptuously.
&#8220;A pretty business for a boy
of twelve!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hatty did not like contempt, and she answered,
hastily: &#8220;I am only two years
younger than you are, and mother says I am
farther advanced in some of my studies!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah for the red-head; touch her, and
she goes off like a brimstone match!&#8221; said
Marcus, triumphantly, for he was tired of
having all the crossness on his own side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hatty&#8217;s hair isn&#8217;t red,&#8221; said Meg, angrily.
&#8220;I heard a lady say, the other day, it was
beautiful auburn hair; and she said Hatty
was sweet-looking and good, and that is more
than anybody will say of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad boy! bad boy! Go away!&#8221; said
Harry, lifting his fat little leg and trying to
kick Marcus with his wee foot.</p>

<p>Hatty could not reprove the children, for
she herself had set the example of speaking
angry words.</p>

<p>Heartily ashamed of herself, she said: &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
am very sorry I spoke so to you, Marcus; it
was not right. I ought not to mind being
put with Meg, for she is a dear little girl,
and I love her very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I love Hatty, and you shan&#8217;t be
cross to her,&#8221; said Meg, putting her arms
round Hatty.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Hatty who was cross,&#8221; said the
little girl, sadly. &#8220;Poor Hatty is only <i>trying</i>
to be good. She does wrong very, very
often.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hatty dood! Hatty dood!&#8221; said Harry,
nestling at her side.</p>

<p>Marcus walked away, without saying another
word. He took his fishing-rod, and
Hatty saw him no more that day.</p>

<p>When Marcus came home in the evening
he was very tired. The family had all done
supper. He took what he wanted, alone,
and then went up to bed without saying
&#8220;good-night&#8221; to any body. When he got
into his own room, he saw on the floor by
his bed a beautiful pair of slippers, with dogs&#8217;
heads worked neatly upon them. He took
off his heavy shoes. How comfortable the
slippers felt to his tired feet! Such an excellent
fit&mdash;so loose and easy! &#8220;How kind in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
mother to make them!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;When
could she have had the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcus was going to rush to the door of
Aunt Barbara&#8217;s room to thank his mother,
when he saw a little note lying on the table.
He broke it open and read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Marcus: It has made me very sad
all the week to think you were displeased
with me. I love you very dearly, and cannot
bear to have you look at me as if you
did not care for me. I know I made you
angry by speaking about the mark at school.
If I had not cared for you I should not have
spoken as I did. I hope you will yet tell
Mr. Briggs. Perhaps I am too naughty myself
to give anybody advice. Please forgive
me all I have ever done wrong to you.&mdash;I
began to work these slippers as soon as I got
home from grandma&#8217;s, and they were only
finished this week. I hope they will fit you.&mdash;Won&#8217;t
you be pleasant to-morrow morning
to your sister Hatty?&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcus read the note, with the slippers on
his feet. He felt ashamed of his unkindness
to his little sister, and he resolved to meet
her pleasantly in the morning. Marcus did
not go to sleep until late that night, but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
will not tell what was the subject of his
thoughts.</p>

<p>The next morning Marcus&#8217; ill humor
seemed to have all passed away. He made
no apology to Hatty for his late rudeness,
but she was generous enough to forget the
past. She did not now in her turn sulk and
pout, and so keep up the quarrel, but she received
him as cheerfully as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>Marcus wore the new slippers, and declared
he had never had a present that suited
him better, and Hatty was repaid for all her
trouble.</p>

<p>Hatty fancied that at church Marcus was
more attentive than usual, and once she
thought she saw him wipe his eyes, as if he
were affected by something the clergyman
said; but she was soon afraid she had been
mistaken, for he began to look about as
usual, and even exchanged a glance of recognition
with one of his acquaintances in the
gallery.</p>

<p>Hatty felt anxious for her brother, and she
was particularly tender and kind in her manner
towards him all day, and in the evening,
when she went to bed, she prayed earnestly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that God would soften his heart, and lead
him to do right. Hatty had not forgotten
that Marcus had acted a lie, and she remembered
that our Heavenly Father is &#8220;a God
who hateth a lie.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII.</h2>


<div class="initial" style="clear: both">
<img src="images/dropcap_70.jpg" alt="M" title="M" /></div>
<p class="dropcapsection"><span class="firstwords">
<span style="display: none;">M</span>onday</span> morning rose bright and
clear. For many days Aunt Barbara
had been steadily gaining, and
now she was coming down stairs,
for the first time. Hatty felt it a
pleasure to wait upon her mother,
while she assisted the old lady to dress, and
even Marcus seemed pleased to be useful.
He and Jane carried down the old-fashioned
easy chair, which Aunt Barbara particularly
fancied, and then he drew a small table near
it, placed a footstool beside it, and stood
waiting to see if he could be of any further
assistance. Mr. Lee helped Aunt Barbara
down very tenderly, and looked at her as affectionately
as if she were a dear little child instead
of a poor invalid, tottering with age and
sickness.</p>

<p>Marcus expected to hear Aunt Barbara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
say, &#8220;This room is too light for anybody,&#8221;
or &#8220;My! who could have chosen such a
place for my chair?&#8221; but he was mistaken.</p>

<p>Aunt Barbara sunk down among the pillows
which Hatty had arranged, quite exhausted,
and for a while was too weak to say
one word. Mrs. Lee brought her a glass of
wine, and a light biscuit, and when Aunt
Barbara had taken them she seemed better.</p>

<p>Then she looked round the cheerful library,
and said, &#8220;How pleasant it is here, and how
nicely you have prepared for me! And you
helped, too, Marcus; that was kind!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad you are pleased!&#8221; said
Marcus; and away he ran to school, feeling
more light-hearted than he had done for many
days. Mrs. Lee said she would take care of
the children in the nursery, as Jane must be
busy, and leave Hatty with Aunt Barbara.
Hatty was glad to be trusted, and she
brought her sewing, and took a low seat near
the old lady.</p>

<p>Aunt Barbara did not seem inclined to
talk at first, and Hatty kept very quiet,
though every now and then she opened her
mouth as if she were going to speak, and then
shut it again quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>Hatty had learned that there are often
times when older people do not care to hear
even pleasant young voices. She had found
out that a little happy child may show a great
deal of unselfishness by keeping quiet, when
she would gladly let her tongue speak out
the joy that is in her heart. Hatty tried to
think over all the hymns she had ever learned,
and so be silent until Aunt Barbara
should choose to speak.</p>

<p>Hatty&#8217;s lips were beginning to feel quite
stiff with their unusual effort, when Aunt
Barbara said, &#8220;Hatty, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hatty looked up suddenly, (Aunt Barbara
had never called her &#8220;my dear&#8221; before,) but
she only said &#8220;What, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; and then waited
to see what would come next.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you love your grandma?&#8221; asked
Aunt Barbara.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I do!&#8221; said Hatty, warmly.
&#8220;She is the dearest and sweetest old lady in
the world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is older than I am, I believe, and a
great deal more wrinkled,&mdash;at least I have
heard so!&#8221; said Aunt Barbara.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I never thought about that;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
she looks very sweet to me!&#8221; said Hatty,
with a puzzled look.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had a notion,&#8221; said Aunt Barbara,
&#8220;that children did not like old people, and
perhaps I have not tried to make myself
pleasant to them. Do you think if I tried to
be like your grandma you could love me,
too?&#8221; and the old lady looked earnestly at
the little girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Aunt Barbara, I love you now!&#8221; said
Hatty affectionately; &#8220;and you grow more
like grandma every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear child!&#8221; said Aunt Barbara, and
she laid her thin hand on the head of the
little girl. After a moment&#8217;s pause she went
on&mdash;&#8220;Hatty, I think I must have been very
cross before I was sick; somehow everything
seemed wrong to me. I am sorry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I and Marcus and Meg and all of us are
sorry we were so naughty. It was our fault,
Aunt Barbara,&mdash;and we mean to be better,&#8221;
said Hatty, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old Aunt Barbara did wrong, too,
child. God has laid her on her bed of sickness
to think, and he has raised her up again
for some good purpose. Perhaps he wanted
to give her an opportunity to be more like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
what a person ought to be, who has had
more than seventy years of blessings, and
who has the promise of a home in Heaven.
Aunt Barbara means to try not to be fretful,
and you children must have patience with
her if she don&#8217;t always speak just as she
should.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old lady was in earnest, and tears
rolled down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Hatty rose and wiped them away,&mdash;then
she kissed Aunt Barbara, tenderly, and said,
&#8220;We will never think any harm of what
dear Aunt Barbara says,&mdash;for we all love
you, and mean to make you very happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Barbara now asked Hatty to sing
some sweet hymns; and she looked so quiet
and peaceful as she listened, that Hatty could
not help thinking that Jesus must be very
near to old people, who are almost at the
golden gate of Heaven.</p>

<p>From that time Hatty was much with
Aunt Barbara; and it was touching to see
how hard the old lady tried to be gentle and
pleasant.</p>

<p>Hatty&#8217;s example had a great influence on
the other children. Meg learned to skip
more softly as she passed Aunt Barbara&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
door; and Harry never ate an orange without
pattering along to Aunt Barbara&#8217;s room,
to give her a taste.</p>

<p>In their hearts the children often acknowledged
that it was their own thoughtlessness
which had brought about much of the old
lady&#8217;s harshness; and now that they were
more gentle and considerate, they found her
a dear, kind friend, who had pleasant stories
to tell, of days gone by; and with her Hatty
had many sweet talks of the loving Saviour,
whom they were both striving to serve.</p>

<span style="display: none;">W</span>hen</span> Marcus came home from
school on Monday afternoon,
Hatty was in the garden, picking
a bouquet to put in Aunt
Barbara&#8217;s room. He stepped
quietly behind her and put his
hands round her waist, before she heard him
coming.</p>

<p>She looked round, expecting to see his face
full of fun; but it was very sober,&mdash;and he
said, quietly,</p>

<p>&#8220;I have lost the prize, Hatty!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you miss a lesson to-day!&#8221; said
Hatty, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not made a mistake this term,
and I don&#8217;t mean to, if I can help it,&#8221; said
Marcus, rather proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a mark for misconduct?&#8221; said Hatty,
anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>&#8220;A mark for tardiness stands against my
name. I have told Mr. Briggs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hatty turned towards her brother, and
kissed him tenderly. He did not push her
away, but, putting his arm round her waist,
he walked a few moments along the path in
silence; then he said, &#8220;I have had a talk
with Mr. Briggs, that I hope I shall never
forget. I thank you, Hatty, for being a true
sister to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Marcus broke away from Hatty, and
ran into the house before she could speak a
word in reply.</p>

<p>Hatty finished gathering the flowers, but
her thoughts were not on her bouquet, but
on her brother. In her heart she thanked
God for prompting him to take this first
right step, and earnestly she prayed that he
might go steadily forward in the path that
leadeth unto life.</p>

<p class="dropcapsection"><span class="firstwords">
<span style="display: none;">T</span>he</span> weeks flew by, and Aunt Barbara
was able first to take a short
drive, and then to be in the air hour
after hour.</p>

<p>One Saturday Mr. Lee pushed
back his chair, after dinner, and
looking pleasantly round on his children,
said, &#8220;What do you all say to a visit to Mr.
Sparrow&#8217;s peach orchard to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young faces flushed back a glad response,
and every little voice was raised in a
joyous welcome to the proposal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Barbara must go, too,&#8221; said Meg,
giving the old lady a protective look, which,
although it was quite absurd, sprang from
real kindness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Aunt Barbara must go, of course,&#8221;
said Mr. Lee, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Hatty, Hatty so dood,&#8221; put in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Harry, as he laid his plump hand caressingly
on Hatty&#8217;s white arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, every one must go, if the carriage
is as full as the shoe where the old woman
lived, with that wonderfully large family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope none of us will have to be
whipped and sent to bed,&#8221; said Meg, laughingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. You shall all have peaches
and bread, instead,&#8221; said Mr. Lee, with a
quizzical look.</p>

<p>The children all laughed so much at what
they thought a charming witticism on their
father&#8217;s part, that they could hardly hear his
voice when he spoke again to say they must
be ready in an hour; and then away he
went, to give orders about the carriage.</p>

<p>At the first mention of the excursion
Marcus had darted away to get his fishing-tackle
in order; for he knew there was a
famous trouting stream on Mr. Sparrow&#8217;s
farm, and he meant to have sport, for which
he cared more than for bushels of peaches.</p>

<p>The hour passed quickly away in busy
preparation for the coming pleasure, and all
were ready when the great family carriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Mr. Lee had borrowed from his brother,
came up to the door.</p>

<p>The horses seemed as full of glee as the
children, and Mr. Lee could not leave them
to attend to the ladies. Marcus assisted
Aunt Barbara very carefully down to the
gate, and handed her in so dexterously that
she was able to take her seat without complaining
of twisting her joints with the exertion.
Then Mrs. Lee was escorted with
great ceremony, by Marcus, and placed at
Aunt Barbara&#8217;s side. Jane (with the baby
in her arms) and Hatty took up the middle
seat. Marcus was to sit with his father,&mdash;but
what was to become of Harry and Meg.
The little things looked disconsolate as they
saw the places filling up; but Hatty called
out, cheerily, &#8220;I will hold Meg,&#8221; and Marcus
said, almost in the same breath, &#8220;Harry must
sit on my knee, that all the gentlemen may
be together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All de dentlemen todedder!&#8221; said Harry,
with a pompous look, as he stood ready to
be lifted to the place of honor assigned him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now are all packed in tight?&#8221; said Mr.
Lee, as he drew up the reins in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; was the merry shout within,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
and away went the horses, as if they enjoyed
the sport.</p>

<p>The swift motion through the cool air
made Hatty glad to draw close round her the
shawl she had thrown over her bare neck
and arms; and Mrs. Lee reached forward to
fold the baby&#8217;s blanket closely about it.</p>

<p>Hatty soon found Meg rather heavy, and
she might have made the whole party uncomfortable
by complaining,&mdash;but she had
learned that one way of doing right is, to
check all complaints about trifles, and to be
as cheerful as possible.</p>

<p>After a while Meg slipped quietly down
into the bottom of the carriage, and said she
had a charming seat there on the baby&#8217;s
strong basket. She did not say that she saw
sister Hatty was weary, and wished to relieve
her. Little Meg was learning something
of Christian kindness; so true is it
that where one child in a family is really
trying to do right, all the others soon catch
something of her spirit.</p>

<p>It was a real treat to the children to be
fairly outside the town, among green fields
and pleasant woods. Mrs. Lee had to keep
her head bobbing this way and that way, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
see a flock of turkeys that made Meg laugh;
or a wild flower that pleased Hatty; or a
&#8220;pretty moo cow&#8221; that Harry thought quite
extraordinary.</p>

<p>Marcus, meanwhile, was sitting up beside
his father, and trying to talk learnedly of
&#8220;crops and fallow-land, good timber, and
pretty fair orchards.&#8221; His father listened
when he spoke, and quietly corrected his
mistakes, without showing him the least sign
of contempt, or making him feel his youth
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee saw that Marcus was bent upon
appearing like a man, and he only tried to
make him a sensible, accurate little man, instead
of putting him down in a way likely
to provoke him.</p>

<p>All Marcus&#8217; <i>mannish</i> ways went off, suddenly,
when the carriage drew up at Mr.
Sparrow&#8217;s door. He leaped from his seat,
and without waiting to hand out the ladies
and children, he gave a merry shout, and
started off for the brook at a pace that most
men find neither easy nor comfortable.</p>

<p>Good farmer Sparrow was away in the
orchard; but stout Mrs. Sparrow helped
Aunt Barbara out as well as if she had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
a man; and by that time Mr. Lee had tied
the horses, and was ready to lift down the
children; Meg came out with a flying skip,
and Hatty bounded down cheerfully; but
Harry was so sleepy, that his father had to
lift him as if he were a bag of meal.</p>

<p>The sight of the peach orchard was enough
to fill the children with astonishment,&mdash;the
rich fruit looked so beautifully, hanging on
the bending boughs. Aunt Barbara was
placed on a comfortable chair by the window;
Mrs. Lee took the baby,&mdash;and then Jane and
the children went out into the peach orchard,
with Mrs. Sparrow.</p>

<p>The farmer&#8217;s wife knew exactly to what
trees to take them; and she reached up and
picked two of the largest peaches Hatty had
ever seen, and placed one in the little girls&#8217;
hands. Away went Hatty back to the
house with her treasures, and when she had
given them to Aunt Barbara and her mother,
she was ready for her own pleasure.</p>

<p>Hatty was learning to think of others first,
even in trifles.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee had told the children just how
many peaches they must eat; and after they
had come up to the number she named, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
enjoyed going about with Mrs. Sparrow, and
watching her while she filled the large basket
that had been placed in the carriage, in front
of Mr. Lee, for the purpose. Hatty could not
help thinking, as she looked at the trees loaded
with the beautiful fruit, how kind it was in
our Heavenly Father to make so much that
is &#8220;pleasant to the eye and good for food,&#8221;
that we may take without breaking any of
his commandments. She pitied poor Eve, if
the forbidden fruit looked anything like
those tempting peaches, and was glad that
there was no &#8220;serpent&#8221; at farmer Sparrow&#8217;s
that pleasant day.</p>

<p>Hatty forgot that there is temptation
every where, if not quite in the form that
was tried upon Eve.</p>

<p>After the children had enjoyed the orchard
to their hearts&#8217; content, little Harry grew
tired, and Jane took him to rest. Mrs. Sparrow
and her strong maid carried in the
heavy basket of peaches, and Hatty and
Meg had permission to wander about to look
at the chickens, the bee-hives, or anything
else that might interest them.</p>

<p>Meg was full of glee, and would gladly
have chased the chickens, handled the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
ducks, and teazed the turkey-gobbler till he
was quite in a passion. Hatty checked her
as gently as she could, and managed to keep
her for some time from doing any actual
mischief.</p>

<p>Meg was charmed when she got to the
bee-hives. She had lately heard Marcus
discoursing, in his most learned manner, as
to the habits and peculiarities of bees, and
she was curious to see these wise little insects
in their own home.</p>

<p>Hatty was glad to find her at last so absorbed
as to be willing to be quiet a moment,
and, a little relieved from her anxiety, she
turned away to look at a curious plant that
was growing in a small swampy place, into
which the surplus water from the large back-yard
was made to flow.</p>

<p>The plant was, indeed, worth looking
at; it was the pitcher plant, or side-saddle-flower,&mdash;every
leaf of which is so formed as
to hold water. She walked round and round
it, looking into each pitcher-like leaf, and
thinking of the wonderful variety which God
has chosen to make even in the forms of the
leaves, not to speak of the many-hued
flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>Turning accidentally towards Meg, Hatty
saw her slender brown arms pushing with
all their might against one of the hives, and
it was evident from Meg&#8217;s determined air
that she had made up her mind to do something&mdash;some
mischief, Hatty concluded, of
course, and hurried to the spot.</p>

<p>She only reached it in time to see the hive
tumbling over, while a swarm of angry bees
came forth to avenge themselves for this
overthrow of their home.</p>

<p>The very impulsiveness of character, which
made Hatty open to temptation from a hasty
temper, now made her think and act quickly.</p>

<p>She saw at once the danger that Meg was
in, from the angry insects. It was but the
work of a second for Hatty to throw her light
shawl completely over Meg&mdash;the child&#8217;s straw
hat&mdash;holding it at such a distance from her
face and arms that the stings of the insects
could not reach her.</p>

<p>Then, with one hand, Hatty held her white
sun-bonnet close together in front, while she
extended the other, to lead Meg.</p>

<p>Over Hatty&#8217;s bare neck and arms the bees
now settled, and began to vent their anger in
sharp stings that made her scream with pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>The cries of the children quickly brought
Mr. Lee and Farmer Sparrow, who had been
taking a survey of the place, together.</p>

<p>Farmer Sparrow bade Mr. Lee keep at a
distance, as soon as he saw, from the over-turned
hive, and from the moving black spots
on Hatty&#8217;s fair neck and arms, what was the
matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee found it hard to keep away from
his children when they were in such trouble,
but he knew it was best to obey.</p>

<p>With a dexterous turn of the shawl, Farmer
Sparrow shut the bees up in it, while he
bade Meg run for her life. She needed no
second command, and was soon sobbing in
her father&#8217;s arms.</p>

<p>The few bees who had escaped from the
shawl settled upon Farmer Sparrow, but he
minded them no more than if they were so
many flies, for the sagacious insects knew
him too well to sting him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand quite still, child!&#8221; said Farmer
Sparrow to Hatty, in a tone of command. It
would have been hard for Hatty to obey,
covered as she was with the tormenting bees,
but for the belief that the prayer for help
that she had sent up to God in her distress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
was about to be answered. One by one Farmer
Sparrow picked off the bees with his
hands, and slipped them into the shawl, which
he held like a bag. They seemed to own
him as a master, and not one offered him a
disrespectful sting.</p>

<p>When Hatty was freed from her tormentors
she was in a piteous plight, her neck and
arms being spotted over with the painful
stings. Hatty struggled hard to bear them
patiently, and Farmer Sparrow declared she
was a perfect soldier.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Sparrow were now on
the spot. The latter hastened to bind indigo
on the wounded parts, and poor Hatty soon
presented an odd appearance, her white face
peering out from her blue wrappings.</p>

<p>Farmer Sparrow excused himself from any
further attendance upon the party, as he must
secure his beloved bees ere they were lost to
him.</p>

<p>The sun was now sinking in the west, and
Marcus, laden with the results of his successful
trouting, came whistling up to the farmhouse.
He heard, in silence, the story of
Hatty&#8217;s misfortune; but when his mother
came quite to the end, Marcus walked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
to his sister, and kissing her fondly, said:
&#8220;You are a splendid girl, Hatty. You ought
to have been a boy!&#8221; Then, turning to Meg,
his indignation burst upon her, and he could
not find words strong enough to express his
anger at her mischief, and his conviction of
the severity of the punishment she deserved.</p>

<p>Meg could only reply in sobs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Meg is punished sufficiently by
seeing her sister suffer. I think she will not
soon forget this lesson!&#8221; said Mrs. Lee,
kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meg did not know the harm she was
doing!&#8221; added Hatty, pleadingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only wanted to look inside,&#8221; said poor
Meg, in the midst of her sobs. &#8220;I thought the
wise little bees knew too much to hurt us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope my little Meg will remember,
hereafter, &#8216;to touch not, taste not, handle not&#8217;
what is not her own,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee, soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I will try,&#8221; answered Meg, earnestly.
&#8220;Do kiss me, Hatty,&#8221; and the child
turned her swollen face towards her generous
sister.</p>

<p>Hatty kissed her, and assured her the pain
of the stings was almost gone, and that she
should soon be quite well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Mr. Lee was now ready with the horses,
and the little party set out for home.</p>

<p>As Hatty rode along in the carriage, and
all seemed so tenderly interested for her, the
little girl went back in memory to the time
before she started on that all important visit
to her grandmother.</p>

<p>She recalled the frequent reproofs she then
received from her mother, the stern displeasure
of her father, her constant quarrels with
Marcus, her impatience with Meg, and the
saucy replies of the child. It seemed strange
to her to remember that even Harry did not
then like to be with her, and that she thought
it quite a trial to be left with Aunt Barbara
even for a few moments. Were all changed,
or was the change in herself? When she
thought all around her severe, cross, or
quarrelsome, must not the fault have been in
a great measure her own?</p>

<p>Hatty could not bear to think of her old
naughty self, and she turned with pleasure to
the happy present. God had given her the
wish to do right, and granted his blessing on
her sincere efforts. How near and dear now
seemed that Heavenly Father to his little one;
she realized that He was at her side; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
needed not to wait until she reached home to
thank Him for his mercies. Into her heart she
knew He was then looking, and beholding
her gratitude there.</p>

<p>Little Hatty felt very happy as she glanced
round on the kind faces, beaming lovingly
on her. Surrounded by such affection, she
could bear almost anything. Yes, Hatty
Lee, who once so dreaded pain, knew now
that wrong, angry feelings, in herself, or the
disapproval of her earthly parents, or the
smile of her mother withdrawn, were far
greater trials than the slight sufferings her
body had been called to endure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI.</h2>


<div class="initial" style="clear: both">
<img src="images/dropcap_92.jpg" alt="H" title="H" /></div>
<p class="dropcapsection"><span class="firstwords">
<span style="display: none;">H</span>atty&#8217;s</span> wounded neck and arms
healed rapidly, but the red spots remained
for many days to remind all
the family of the late accident, and
make them more tender than usual
in their manner to the courageous
little girl.</p>

<p>Marcus seemed to have quite changed his
opinion of his sister, and felt called upon to
treat her with marked respect, and to honor
her with many long talks on his favorite subjects.</p>

<p>Hatty heard his footstep in the hall, as he
was returning from school one afternoon,
shortly after the accident. She knew that
on that day was to be awarded the prize for
which he had so faithfully labored, and
which he had been induced to forfeit for the
sake of truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>She felt great sympathy for him, and was
planning in her own mind how she could
best cheer him under his disappointment,
when he threw open the door, and with a
joyous bound sprang towards her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Hatty!&#8221; he said, as he laid on her
lap the richly bound copy of Virgil which
he had so desired for its own sake, as well as
a mark of his teacher&#8217;s approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is mine, given in the presence of the
school, by Mr. Briggs!&#8221; said Marcus, with a joyous
smile, &#8220;And I owe it all to you, Hatty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad!&#8221; said Hatty, with real
pleasure. &#8220;But you do not owe it to me,
Marcus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Hatty,&#8221; continued Marcus,&mdash;&#8220;Mr.
Briggs knew all about my being late, and he
was waiting for me to acknowledge it; if I
had not I should have lost his confidence,
and the prize would never have been mine,
he said: as it was, no other boy stood as high
as I did! Isn&#8217;t it splendid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very, very glad,&#8221; repeated Hatty.
&#8220;Is it not better always to try to do right,
Marcus!&#8221; she added softly.</p>

<p>Marcus opened his mouth as if to speak,
then turned silently away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>That evening Mrs. Lee sat in the library,
in the twilight, with Marcus and Hatty. She
too had heard about the prize, and had rejoiced
with her son, with a silent prayer in
her heart that he might see the wisdom of
the Better Path, and be led always to do right
by the happy results which had followed the
step that had cost him such an effort.</p>

<p>After the subject of the prize had been discussed,
a feeling of quietness stole over the
little group; perhaps all had their own serious
thoughts at that twilight hour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Hatty,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee, pleasantly,
&#8220;can you not recite a hymn for us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee almost feared that Marcus would
walk away at this proposal, as he had often
done before, on similar occasions; but he sat
down at his mother&#8217;s side, and listened,
while Hatty repeated, in a voice of deep feeling,
the hymn,&mdash;&#8220;Ashamed of Jesus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; said Hatty, earnestly, when she
had done speaking, &#8220;Do you think anybody
in a Christian country was ever <i>ashamed of
Jesus?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are few in a christian country, my
dear, who would be willing to be called infidels,
or heathen,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee, soberly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
&#8220;and I doubt if there are any young people
who have heard of Jesus, who would not
shrink from the thought. Though this is
quite true, there are many who are ashamed
of Jesus&mdash;many children, I fear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Mother! what do you mean?&#8221; said
Hatty, earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee, &#8220;there are many
who are ashamed to have it known that they
wish to serve him. They would rather their
best actions should be attributed to any
cause, than a desire to do His will. They hide
their best feelings, and struggle to show indifference
when holy things are named, in a
way which proves them at heart to be
<i>ashamed</i> of Jesus. Alas, poor foolish children!
what will be their lot when he is
ashamed of them, in the presence of his
Father in Heaven!&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcus had laid his head on his mother&#8217;s
hand, as he sat beside her, and now she felt
the hot tears trickle over it.</p>

<p>Hatty was questioning in heart whether
she could be so situated as to be <i>ashamed of
Jesus</i>, when Marcus suddenly rose, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I have been ashamed of
Jesus! Let me say now to you, dear Mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and to Hatty, that I do wish to serve Him,
and I want you both to help me.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will together ask God for his help,
which is better than any human arm, my
dear son,&#8221; said Mrs. Lee, solemnly.</p>

<p>The mother knelt down with her children,
and earnestly implored God&#8217;s blessing on
their young hearts. Fervently she asked the
Great Heavenly Friend so to guide and sustain
them in the upward path, that they
might at last be gathered to his Eternal Home,
with all those that love Him in sincerity and
truth.</p>

<p>When they rose from their knees, Hatty&#8217;s
heart was too full of joy for words. She
walked to Marcus&#8217; side, and putting her arm
about him, kissed him, with a deep, trusting
affection she had never felt before.</p>

<p>Now came in Aunt Barbara, leading little
Harry, full of glee, while Meg followed, with
her usual cheerful skip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us have one more hymn before supper,&#8221;
said Mrs. Lee, as she gathered the little
group around her. &#8220;We will have &#8216;I want
to be like Jesus,&#8217; and only those must sing
who really feel what they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Lee began in her own clear, sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
voice. Hatty quickly followed, and Marcus
united with her in trembling tones, with sober
earnestness. Meg, with her childlike warble,
and even little Harry, felt that he wanted to
be like Jesus, and tried to lisp in &#8220;sweet accord&#8221;
his Saviour&#8217;s name, blending his baby
notes with those that fell from Aunt Barbara&#8217;s
faltering tongue.</p>

<p>How welcome to the father&#8217;s ear, as he
returned from his daily toil, was that evening
hymn!</p>

<p>At the closing verse his manly tones were
heard as a deep, full echo to the rest, while
devout thanksgiving filled the mother&#8217;s heart.</p>

<p>And Hatty&mdash;little Hatty&mdash;she felt almost
too happy for earth; and fully she realized
the truth, that &#8220;Wisdom&#8217;s ways are pleasantness,
and all her paths are peace.&#8221;</p>
